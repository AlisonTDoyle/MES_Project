# Project 400 - Manufacturing Execution System
The goal of this project is to make a small scale MES (Manufacturing Execution System). The repository currently contains two application to help with its development and demo-ing

- **mock-erp**: This is a simple web app that only contains a form that generates an XML file. As the name suggests, its purpose is to just mock the ERP integration with the rest of the project.
- **mes-gui**: This is the main application and the GUI for the whole system. This application is designed for supervisors and operators. It gives an overview of the current state of the factory/your current work depending on what type of user is signed in.
- **mes-api**: Middle man between the GUI application and the backend.
